**Runtimes**  
All computer languages have a runtime. This is where the code executes, or “runs.” The runtime determines a lot as to how the language works, how powerful it is, what sorts of bugs/problems to expect, etc. Understanding the nature of the runtime you’re working is a critical skill for any developer. In web development, there are two main runtimes—client-based runtimes (usually the browser) and server-based runtimes (like the Java Virtual Machine or the PHP “engine”).
