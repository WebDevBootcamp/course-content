# FRCC WebLab - Servers & Server-Side Concepts

**Server-Side Runtimes**  
As discussed, all computer languages have a runtime where code executes. The web was really transformed from a “document space” to an “application space” (though initially with significant limitations) with the advent of application servers, which were among the first server-based runtimes that executed code and returned results to browsers. And one of the most important specific examples of this was code that pulled data from a database, perhaps manipulated it in some way, and then sent those results to end-user browsers/clients.
