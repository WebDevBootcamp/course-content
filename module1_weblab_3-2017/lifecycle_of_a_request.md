## First Programming Task

Roomies App (like Besties!)

* 60 school-aged children; 31 boys, 29 girls
* 10 dorm rooms, 4-8 children in each room
* Same-sex rooms only!
* Kicker: Each child can have a besties list of up to 4 roomates, and everyone is guaranteed at least 1 roommate from his/her besties list
* Management needs this app completed, tested and launched by the end of the day!
