# FRCC WebLab - History of the Internet

The Internet has had history’s most transformative impact on life; perhaps more so, even, than the invention of the printing press. Of particular significance is the creation of an entirely new layer of the economy—the so-called “new economy” of “knowledge workers.” Many of the very best jobs available in the 21st-century world are in this relatively new area of the economy. An appreciation of the history and evolution of the Internet and the web will help workers thrive in this new economy.

## Wikipedia - History of the Internet

* Precursors: Telegraph system, electronic computers in 1950s, independent networks (ARPANET, Usenet, NPL, etc. 
* TCP/IP standardized in 1982 (“Merging the networks and creating the Internet”).

## Wikipedia - History of the World Wide Web

Be honest—did you know there was a difference?

Highlights:

* “The Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as e-mail also does.”
* The web is a collection of “pages.” (Though page vs. “screen” concepts are changing dramatically over time). 
* 1990: Basic elements of the web complete—HTTP, HTML, web browser and web server.
* Commercialization of the web leads to “dot com bubble,” followed by a more “mature” web.
* The web today—web 2.0 and beyond.
