Psuedocode
==========

  * Like a computer language, but isn't
  * Used to capture ideas without getting bogged down in language details
  * A way of communicating algorithms with other programmers
  
Variables
---------
  * Named storage
  * Used like the X and Y in algebra
  * Can be assigned values
'''
  X = 5
'''
  * Can be assigned to hold values from other variables
'''
  X = temperature
'''
  * Can be assigned the result of mathematical calculations
'''
  X = (5 * temperature) / 8 + 32
'''

Conditional Statements
----------------------
  * Start with the keyword 'if'
  * Followed by condition to test (e.g. X < 5)
  * Then there is a block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  * An optional block of code to be executed if the condition is not true is preceeded by the keyword 'else'
  * Example:
'''
  if (X < 5)
    Y = X * 3
    output Y
  else
    Y = X / 5
'''
